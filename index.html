    <h4 class="background">Background on Information Technology:</h3>
    <p>In my IT studies, I've learned a few important computer languages. One is Python. It's like a magic tool that can do many things, like counting and building websites. Another is C#. It's good for making software that works on computers.
        I've also learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS are like the building blocks of websites. HTML helps make the structure, and CSS makes it look nice. JavaScript is different—it helps make websites fun and interactive.<br><br>
        By doing projects and practicing, I've gotten better at using these tools. I'm excited to keep learning and using Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make cool things with technology.</p>
